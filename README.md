# KNN-Algorithm
The KNN classification algorithm is a theoretically mature method and one of the simplest machine learning algorithms. According to this method, if the majority of k samples most similar to one sample (nearest neighbors in the eigenspace) belong to a specific category, this sample also belongs to this category.
